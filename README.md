I teamed up with designer Tomas Benko.<br>

- Game is using Unity 2020.3.48f1 editor
- Consists of:
  - Main menu
  - Tutorial level
  - 2 Levels
- I used Cinemachine for camera movements
- Player has an inventory for 3 weapons, health bar and energy bar
- Creating new types of weapons or hp pots/energy pots is really easy due to implementation of Interfaces.
- AI pathfinding is made using implementation of ![A*]([url](https://arongranberg.com/astar/)https://arongranberg.com/astar/)
